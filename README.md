# Insulin_Pump

To run the final insulin pump project, please do the following:

Firstly, download the project to your computer.
In one tab of VSCode, open “JavaFrameGUI”. Under “src/gui”, open the “gui.java”
class.
In the second tab of VSCode, open “JavaFrameGUI copy”.  Under “src/gui”, “Algorithms_Controllers”, open “Listener.java”.

Make sure to enter the right port number of your computer to the intended places in the code. ( String serverHostname = “----“;)

Firstly, run the gui class. Then, run the listener class. Now, these two are connected. You can play with the interface and see the alarms you get.

There are two PDF files in here. One is my notes from while learning about software developemt and insülin pumps, and one is the Software Requirements Specification file for the Insulin Pump. Send_recieve_trial is a simple Project showing the socket communication. Final_Insulin_Pump is the final software of the Project.
